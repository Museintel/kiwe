## Phase

audit

## Requirements

- raw source plus native Bricks template upload JSON or compiler proof bundle

## Required behavior

- run executable structural/native-coverage validation
- treat the source as the visual contract even when it contains its own responsive defect
- require equal viewport provenance before any visual percentage
- mark mismatched canvas, DPR, page identity, scrollbar geometry, stale target CSS, or foreign overlay contamination INCOMPLETE
- report native coverage and scoped CSS exceptions separately
- fail runtime Code elements unless explicitly marked review-only unsupported exceptions
- fail framework-dependent settings in raw mode

## Outputs

- pass/fail findings only

## Forbidden

- fixes unless /fix is also present
- docs unless /document
- ZIP

## Final response

PASS/FAIL/INCOMPLETE with executable proof, valid visual score when available, blocking errors, and warnings.
