## Requirements

- classified current artifact and human approval for full-flow execution

## Required behavior

- Follow the canonical SeamFlow Start and command manifest.

## Outputs

- final canonical artifacts for the selected flow

## Forbidden

- using prior test material
- loading all contexts upfront
- general web search
- docs unless /document
- ZIP
- DSA/AppShell output unless target requests DSA or combined
- treating missing Site Graph as a blocker for static Bricks conversion

## Final response

Return only final canonical artifacts after every required closing audit for the detected start point has passed, plus compact pass/fail/warn status.
