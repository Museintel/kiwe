## Requirements

- raw HTML/CSS/JS or an existing raw conversion result

## Required behavior

- normalize this legacy command to deterministic raw /convert /bricks followed by optional /seamframework
- never manually rewrite source HTML or production Bricks JSON

## Outputs

- framework/kiwe-framework-profile.json
- bricks-template/[name]-template-upload.json

## Forbidden

- legacy regex/token substitution as production authority
- AI-authored production JSON
- source redesign
- docs unless /document
- ZIP

## Final response

Report that the legacy command was normalized to Convert then Framework and return executable proof.
